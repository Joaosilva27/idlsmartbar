## Overview

The ID Logistics Smartbar is a web application developed using React and styled with Tailwind CSS. It offers a user-friendly interface with both authentication and guest access options. This versatile web app serves as a hub for a wide range of guides, spanning four main topics: TV calibration, screen foil installation, abonnement management, and laptop image installation.

## Problem Statement

When I started my job as a TV calibrator at "IDLogistics," I quickly noticed a frustrating and annoying aspect of the training process. The existing methods for teaching newcomers were far from ideal. Newcomers often had to rely on experienced colleagues to guide them through the intricacies of TV calibration, with specific instructions varying for each television model. Alternatively, there were guides available, but they were often outdated, lengthy, and not conducive to efficient learning.

This unstructured approach to learning the intricacies of TV calibration was not only frustrating but also resulted in a significant knowledge gap and a cumbersome learning curve for new employees like myself. Additionally, there were instances when we encountered rare and uncommon TV models that required specialized calibration techniques. In such cases, only a select few individuals possessed the necessary knowledge, making the calibration process highly dependent on their availability.

## Project Solution

To address these challenges and create a more efficient learning and working environment, I embarked on the development of the IDL Smartbar App. This web application serves as a comprehensive knowledge hub, meticulously summarizing and organizing all relevant information related to TV calibration, screen foil installation, subscription management, and laptop image installation. The Smartbar is designed to be a one-stop resource, allowing both newcomers and experienced professionals to access detailed guides, troubleshooting instructions, and calibration techniques efficiently.

The Smartbar App serves as a dedicated knowledge repository built to our field, alleviating the necessity to depend on colleagues or outdated resources. Smartbar App allows every team member to access essential information autonomously, effectively minimizing downtime and elevating overall productivity. Furthermore, it ensures that we can handle even the rarest TV models without dependence on a select few experts.

## Key Features
